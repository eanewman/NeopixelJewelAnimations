# Neopixel Jewel Animations

## Summary

This basic project explores some possible animations that one can program a [Neopixel Jewel](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2226) to display, using an Arduino (tested with an [Arduino Uno](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno)). 

This project was originally used in a Girls Who Code workshop at Autodesk, Inc. in the summer of 2016. The skeleton program outlines exercises that students can work on to build up different animations, such as a heart that starts beating more and more rapidly until it "explodes" (this is meant to be a happy explosion, not a stressful one!). There is also a branch that has a set of possible answers for reference.
